# FAQ
## How does this work?

## Why is there a 3 GB limit?

This is because the server I use has just 10 GB of disk space. Most of that is used for other (important) stuff and there is only 3.4 GB of space left.

Maybe I will figure out a workaround for this - like streaming download data to upload directly without ever saving to the disk. I could increase the limit to higher values but it has to be there regardless to be fair to everyone else waiting in queue.

## What about bandwidth costs?

Nah that's free.
